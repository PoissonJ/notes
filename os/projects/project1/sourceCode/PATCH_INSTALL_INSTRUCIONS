To get the patch to run, I had to do the following

1) cd /usr/src
1.5) cp get_sc.2 and set_sv.2 to /usr/src/man/man2/
2) run `git apply --reject --whitespace=fix project1-submission.patch`

As a side note, I did first run
 `git apply --ignore-space-change --ignore-whitespace project1-submission.patch`
which did not work. I believe it did not make any
changes to the patch file as well but I just wanted to throw that in there! :)
