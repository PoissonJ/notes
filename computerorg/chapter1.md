# Introduction and Chapter 1

## Computer Abstractions and Technology

### The computer revolution

Moore's Law
  : chip integration is doubled every **18** (or 80) months

Computer processors become more and more powerful and take less power

### Classes of Computers

Personal computers

 * General purpose
 * Subject to cost/performance tradeoff

Server computers

 * Small to building sized

Supercomputers

 * Single sytem which can solve a particular application very fast

Embedded computers

 * Hidden as components of the system
 * Stringent power/performance/cost constraints

### The PostPC Era

Personal Mobile Device

 * Battery operated (Phones)

Cloud Computing

 * Warehouse scale computers (WSC)
 * Software as a Service (SaaS)
 * Amazon and Google

### 8 Great Ideas - Architect

 * Moore's Law
 * Abstraction to simplify design
 * Common case fast
 * Parallelism
 * Pipelining
 * Prediction
 * Hierarchy of memories
 * Dependability

### Below Your Program

Applications Software
  : Written in high-level language
System software
  : compiler...
Hardware
  : processor...

#### Levels of Program Code

High-level --> Assembly language --> Hardware representation (10101001)

### Components of a computer

All Computers have the same components

 * Input/output
 * Processor
 * Memory

### Inside the Processor (CPU)

Datapath
  : performs operations on data
Control
  : sequences datapath, memory
Cache memory
