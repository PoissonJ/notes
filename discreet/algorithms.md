# Algorithms

Algorithms:
  : Series of code to complete tasks.

 * Exists to accomplish some sort of goal and sub goals to complete a program
 * Definite, must be able to define
 * Correctness: results are to be 100% correct
 * Finite
 * Effective
 * Generality

Heuristic:
  : Algorithm that is not guaranteed to be correct.

*Sorting Out Sorting video*

Greedy algorithm:
  : algorithms that try to take what looks to be the next step that looks the
    best toward the completion.

A good greedy algorithm is when making change. We try to give the least amount
of change as possible.
