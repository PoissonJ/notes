# Practice Exam 1

# Problem 1

## a

"There is someone"... `Ex`

"No one" ... `-Ay`

`Ex -Ay (x != y) -> ...`  Use inference to include all domains to which this is
applicable.

## b

Could be interpreted as.. *Only one person is loved by everyone, everyone else
has an enemy*.

The word *exactly* makes it more complex, must filter out the case where z
would equal x whith the above statement in a. Then we must show that someone in
domain y must not love z

# Problem 2

It is possible for Nancy to fool either x or y by replacing z on the right hand
side with x or y

# Problem 3

## a

When negating, any `^` becomes a `v` and any `v` becomes a `^`.

## b

When negating, `E` becomes `A` and `A` becomes `E`.

## c

When negating, `->` becomes left side and not right handside.

# Problem 4

Truth tables will work, but the example shown uses the reference sheet at the
bottom to make the statement equivalent.

# Alternate Problem 5

People

 * Alex
 * Francis
 * Jamie
 * Robin
 * Sam

Each person lives in a separate house

 * Sam lives in the rightmost
 * No two adjacent names live adjacent
 * Alex right of Jamie
 * Robin lives in the center

**Order: Jamie, Alex, Robin, Francis, Sam**
